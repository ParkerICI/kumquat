\usage{
citrus.endpointRegress(modelType, citrus.foldFeatureSet, labels, family, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelType}{Method to be used for model-fitting. Valid options are: \code{glmnet},\code{pamr}, and \code{sam}.}

\item{citrus.foldFeatureSet}{A \code{citrus.foldFeatureSet} object.}

\item{labels}{Vector of endpoint values for analyzed samples.}

\item{family}{Family of model to fit. Valid options are \code{classification} and \code{continuous}.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to model-fitting methods.}
}
\value{
A \code{citrus.regression} object with the following properties:
\item{regularizationThresholds}{Regularization thresholds used to constrain all constructed models. Not applicable for \code{sam} models.}
\item{foldModels}{A \code{citrus.endpointModel} constructed from each independent fold feature set. \code{NULL} if \code{nFolds = 1}.}
\item{finalModel}{A \code{citrus.endpointModel} constructed from features derived from the clustering of all samples together.}
\item{thresholdCVRates}{Matrix containing the average error rate and standard error of models at each regularization threshold. FDR also reported where possible.}
\item{cvMinima}{Values and indicies of pre-selected cross-validation error-rate thresholds.}
\item{differentialFeatures}{Non-zero model features and corresponding clusters from the \code{finalModel} constrained by \code{cvMinima}.}
\item{modelType}{Type of model fit on data.}
\item{family}{Family of regression model.}
\item{labels}{Endpoint labels of analyzed samples.}

\description{
Regress cluster properties against an experimental endpoint of interest. Models are fit on supplied features and constrained 
by regularization thresholds (\code{glmnet} and \code{pamr}) or FDR (\code{sam}). Stratifying features are returned along with 
corresponding cluster IDs.
}
\details{
If independent clusterings are run (i.e. \code{citrus.clusterAndMapFolds} is run with \code{nFolds > 1}), model are fit on each 
feature set calculated for each clustering fold and final regularization thresholds are selected by predicting endpoint values for leftout samples whose data
was mapped to existing cluster space. If a single clustering was run (i.e. \code{citrus.clusterAndMapFolds} is run with \code{nFolds = 1}), 
cross-validation is used to select final regularization thresholds based on features derived from a clustering of all samples. Regardless
of how regularization thresholds are selected, the final reported features are from the final model constructed from all features, constrained by 
identified optimal regularization thresholds.
